Wave_Recorder_And_Visualizer
============================

C# code for recording a wav file from microphone and generating a waveform
____________________________________________________________________
This is in the very early stage of development. 
To record the wave, select one of the available microphones/input devices and click the record button.
To visualize the recorded wave, click the visualize button.
There might be some bugs in the code, so do let me know.
